		<p>All the women who have worked to secure and protect the right to vote for over a century ... I stand on their shoulders," Kamala Harris said addressing the nation for the first time as vice president-elect.<br><br> Harris is the first woman, the first woman of color, the first Black person and the first South Asian to be elected vice president of the United States. </p>
